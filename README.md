# inventory-mgmt - Project 3

A refresh of my department's Inventory Management System

## Value Add Proposal

My department at my current job uses a web-based inventory management system to track components and assemblies during the research and manufacturing process. The current system was developed in 2010 and is in desperate need of an update, from many of the user's perspectives. This application serves to refresh and refactor the technology and performance of the current system.
